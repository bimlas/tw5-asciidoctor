This is a TiddlyWiki plugin for parsing Asciidoctor text, based on the [[Asciidoctor.js|https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js]] project from Asciidoctor Project.

It is completely self-contained, and doesn't need an Internet connection in order to work. It works both in the browser and under Node.js.
